# Membership_survey_dashboard

I created this dashboard in Google Data Studio to consolidate key insights from the alumni survey data into a single, easy-to-understand view. This allows leadership to quickly grasp important trends and make informed decisions about the alumni community.


The dashboard includes an age distribution chart to highlight demographic trends, an income distribution chart to reveal alumni financial capacity and identify potential donor segments, and a ranking chart that shows which membership benefits—such as volunteer opportunities, swag/branded merchandise, and community—are most valued. Additionally, a filter for current donors enables leadership to focus on this critical group. These KPIs provide actionable insights that help guide the refinement of membership initiatives and optimize resource allocation.

The dashboard’s clear and intuitive design uses distinct charts and filtering options to help users quickly identify key patterns and focus on specific segments like current donors. This structure supports data-driven decision-making by enabling leadership to prioritize efforts that will have the most impact on engagement and fundraising outcomes.
